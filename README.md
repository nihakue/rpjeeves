rpjeeves
========

A browser extension that we're working on to help GMs spend more time telling a compelling story, and less time being a computer. We play a lot of pathfinder, but we're sick of (and bad at) all of the bookkeeping needed to run a smooth session, so we're making the tool that we've always wanted.

##Installation
First, you need to clone or fork the repo. Then, read [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked](these) instructions on installing unpacked chrome extensions.

##Feedback
If you do choose to use rpjeeves in this unpacked, unreleased state, we would be tickled to get your feedback. Please use the github issue tracker to report your bugs, and be as descriptive as possible. We are especially interested to hear about SRDs that are not compatible with rpjeeves.

##Contributing
We're a very small team just doing this for fun, and as such don't have much of an official process for contributing. If you'd like to help out, just fork the repository and make some changes/bug fixes. Send us a pull request and we'd be delighted to work with you to incorporate your work.

###Changes
If you make changes to the code, you need to reload the extension in the chrome extension tab before the changes will be visible.
